# MY PAGE
Hello there! I am Atharv and this is a random page of website I decided to create as to... well, look cool. Here goes nothing.

So a little bit about myself, I am an undergrad at IISc who recently (and successfully) completed my 2nd year. I am a Physics major but my passion lies in understanding the world. Too broad? Okay, understanding and trying to make it better. Currently trying to explore the fields of Neuroscience, using computers. HAH!
